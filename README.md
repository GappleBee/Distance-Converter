# GUI-Distance-Converter
This program has a GUI (first program I uploaded to GitHub that has a GUI, also I think every program I upload to GitHub from now on will have a GUI) and can be used to convert miles to kilometres and vice versa, this is also the first program that I have put some comments into (didn't think comments was needed before this until I met a real programmer who was acting as a substitute teacher at my school and he said that I needed comments in my programs). Also, first program I made using Visual Studio (all the other programs I made were made using PyCharm but I switched to Visual Studio because I heard it was the best IDE).

Also, since this program has a GUI, if you don't want a black console to appear then you should run the program with the "pythonw.exe" file rather than the "python.exe" file. Note: if you're trying to run a program that doesn't have a GUI then run it with "python.exe" instead
