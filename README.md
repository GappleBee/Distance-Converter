# GUI-Distance-Converter
This program has a GUI (first program I uploaded to GitHub that has a GUI) and can be used to convert miles to kilometres and vice versa. I do know the bug that if you put an input into one of the entry boxes then the input will also appear in the other box; however, I don't know how to fix this but it doesn't have any effect on the program's function
