# GUI-Distance-Converter
This program has a GUI (first program I uploaded to GitHub that has a GUI) and can be used to convert miles to kilometres and vice versa, this is also the first program that I have put some comments into (didn't think comments was needed before this until I met a real programmer who was acting as a substitute teacher at my school and he said that I needed comments in my programs). Also, first program I made using Visual Studio (all the other programs I made were made using PyCharm but I switched to Visual Studio because I heard it was the best IDE).
